## Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock

Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock serve(提供) two different purposes. Before we talk about them, here’s a summary:

    Cargo.toml is about describing your dependencies in a broad sense(broad sense 广义), and is written by you.
    Cargo.lock contains exact(展开的) information about your dependencies. It is maintained(保护) by Cargo and should not be manually edited.
为什么二进制程序中需要将Cargo.lock放到git版本控制中，而library项目就不能将Cargo.lock放到git版本控制中？这里再FAQ中有解释，不过我没有读懂。

## 让我们再多挖一点。
Cargo.toml is a manifest file in which we can specify a bunch(一串) of different metadata about our project. For example, we can say that we depend on another project:

    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

    [dependencies]
    rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git" }

This project has a single dependency, on the rand library. We’ve stated in this case that we’re relying on a particular Git repository that lives on GitHub. 

这个项目有个单一的依赖，依赖rand库。在这个案例我们规定我们依赖一个处于GitHub上的独特的Git库。

Since we haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes(假定) that we intend to use the latest commit on the master branch to build our project.

Sound good? Well, there’s one problem: If you build this project today, and then you send a copy to me, and I build this project tomorrow, something bad could happen. There could be more commits to rand in the meantime, and my build would include new commits while yours would not. Therefore, we would get different builds. This would be bad because we want reproducible(可复写的) builds.

We could fix this problem by putting a rev line in our Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git", rev = "9f35b8e" }

Now our builds will be the same. But there’s a big drawback(缺点): now we have to manually think about SHA-1s every time we want to update our library. This is both tedious and error prone.(这既乏味又容易出错)

Enter the Cargo.lock. Because of its existence(存在), we don’t need to manually keep track of the exact revisions: Cargo will do it for us. When we have a manifest like this:

    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

    [dependencies]
    rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git" }

Cargo will take the latest commit and write that information out into our Cargo.lock when we build for the first time. That file will look like this:

    [[package]]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    dependencies = [
    "rand 0.1.0 (git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9)",
    ]

    [[package]]
    name = "rand"
    version = "0.1.0"
    source = "git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9"

You can see that there’s a lot more information here, including the exact(严格的) revision we used to build. Now when you give your project to someone else, they’ll use the exact same SHA, even though we didn’t specify it in our Cargo.toml.

When we’re ready to opt in to a new version of the library, Cargo can re-calculate the dependencies and update things for us:

    $ cargo update           # updates all dependencies
    $ cargo update -p rand   # updates just “rand”

This will write out a new Cargo.lock with the new version information. Note that the argument to cargo update is actually a Package ID Specification and rand is just a short specification.
