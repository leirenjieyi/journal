## Project Layout

Cargo uses conventions for file placement to make it easy to dive into a new Cargo project:
Cargo 使用惯例来存放文件，使得对一个新项目更容易上手。

    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── benches
    │   └── large-input.rs
    ├── examples
    │   └── simple.rs
    ├── src
    │   ├── bin

1. Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock are stored in the root of your project (package root).
2. Source code goes in the src directory.
3. The default library file is src/lib.rs.
4. The default executable file is src/main.rs.
5. Other executables can be placed in src/bin/*.rs.
6. Integration tests go in the tests directory (unit tests go in each file they're testing).
7. Examples go in the examples directory.
8. Benchmarks go in the benches directory.

These are explained in more detail in the manifest description.
